    <h1>Fabio, Music Composer and Sound Designer.</h1>
    <img class="left" src="Fabio.png" alt="A Pixel Portrait">

    <p>
      Fabio is a composer and sound designer from Italy, his love story with music technology began in his high school years. For those first, feeble steps into the world of digital audio, 
      a new path was sealed, a destiny forged in ransacking PCs in dumps, playing in bands from psychotic rock to new reggae, microphone experiments going awfully wrong, 
      unlikely but lasting dance music co-operations, and a graveyard of exploded audio cards.
      The frenzy got worse in recent years, as he began being an almost passable composer and orchestrator and started working on music and sound design for Mythical Whalers. 
      God have mercy on us all.
