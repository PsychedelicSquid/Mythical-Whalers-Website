    <h1>Hello! Welcome to my blog for Mythical Whalers,</h1>
    <p>
        Firstly I would like to give a huge thankyou to Trevor Richard for helping me set up this site. 
      Without his help I would likely still be stuck trying to configure a ssh key for a linode server. 
      I would also like to give a shout out to my team, Francesco, Valera, and Fabio. Their talents and passion 
      have brought so much life to this project, I feel incredibly lucky to be working with them. 

        I suppose I should talk a bit about why I'm making Mythical Whalers and what my vision is for the project.
      Maybe a good place to start would be telling the story of how I got started working on Mythical Whalers.

        A year and a half ago I was walking home through the snow on a cold winter evening in Canada. I had just finished a 14 hour shift 
      working on an ambulance as a paramedic. I was exausted but I had several friends on their way over to my small apartment, 
      they had talked me into trying magic mushrooms that evening, it was something I was apprehensive of doing
      but curiosity got the better of me. At around 7pm we all ingested 2.75 grams of Golden Teachers. 
      Half an hour into the trip I was regreting my decision, I was battling nausea and emotions I wasn't aware 
      a person was capable of feeling. It was remarkably unpleasant, waves of nausea washed over me and reality started to disolve.
      About an hour into the trip and still feeling uncomfortable we put on a nature documentary and settled into my couch.

        A few minutes into the film an arctic iceshelf crashed into the ocean, in that moment I was hit by a massive pulse
      of energy, I could feel blood pulse through every artery in my body. Colors became brighter and my vision became crysal clear. 
      The most signifigant change though was I felt I had steped into a different dimmention, or maybe more acuratly 
      percieve a layer of the world I normally couldn't see.

        It was as though my third eye open and could now see things in a way I never had before, a barrier in my mind had disolved and all the
      entities and desires of my subconcious mind that dictated my actions were visable.
      
        During this time I became claustrophobic inside my tiny apartment and had a powerful desire to get under the sky. 
      So me and one of my mates put on our parkas and went outside for a walk while everyone else decided to stay inside 
      where it was warm. As we walked and looked up at the stars I was confronted by my own mortality and what beautiful gift 
      life is. I realized I had a deep sense of disatisfation for my current career, none of the work I did had any permenance.
      All I could do was provide band-aid solutions for largely unsolvable biological problems. Nessisary perhaps, but an excercise in 
      futility if there ever was one. At best providing some comfort and maybe adding a few more days to a life, but more often than
      not simply witnessing the inevitable slowly take it's course.
      
        There was no turning back. I had realized there was no way to preserve the information on my biological hardware and soon everything would be gone.
      I had seen enough strokes and cardiac arrests to know this is true. I realized I wanted to build something with permenance, something that would outlast me.
      I wasn't sure what I wanted to create but I had an intuition that constructing something in the digital world was the way to trancend the limitations of the 
      physical world. Learning to code seemed like the first step in manifesting that vision,
      I was convinced the digital world could be a silcone life raft and code was the portal to get on to it.

        Over the following months I started learning the coding language python, it was surprising intuitive and soon I was able to 
      create simple applications. After a few begginer projects I wanted to create something more advanced. I started using the pygame
      library to create a simple tilemap with a sprite a player could move around, it was all so easy... how hard could it be to make a game?
      
        I had always loved roguelike games, they scratched an itch no other game could. Exploring a proceeduraly generated 
      world no other human has ever seen before provides a level of novelty liniar games can't compete with. Combine that with some clever
      artificial inteligence and you can produce some truly immersive virtual worlds. 
      
        Dwarf Fortress was a game I found particularily intriging. Underneath the ASCI graphics and unintutive graphics is 
      a complex virtual world.
