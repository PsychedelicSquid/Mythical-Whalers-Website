    <h1>The World</h1>
    <p>
        Designing a world where the player feels like they are a part of a larger ecosystem has been 
        a priority of mine. In Mythical Whalers there are many Civilizations ranging from the noble Mer 
        to the savage Shrikes of the jungle. The player can gain or lose reputation with the these factions
        depending on the choices they make as they play, the player can even influence relations between these 
        races, either coaxing races towards peace or provoking war.
