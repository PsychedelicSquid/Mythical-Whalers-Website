      Designing the art work for Mythical Whalers has been a slow and meticulous ordeal, pretty much all 
      the art in the game has been through many iterations.

      During initial prototypes of tilesets I noticed how jarring the borders were between the square tiles.
      The transitions had a very square abrupt transitions which I wasn't a fan of. While experimenting with 
      designing tile transitions I remembered my favorite dwarf fortress tileset.

      The "Gemset" tileset by DragonDePlatino solves several problems, first by replacing 
      ASCII charachters by simple sprites it is much easier to tell what was happening at a glance.
      Secondly it conveyed the type of tiles by showing a simple image on a black background, this allows 
      for much smoother transitions between different tiles giving it a much smoother apearance. 
      I was mesmorized by how elegant and pragmatic this solution was.
